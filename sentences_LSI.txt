Latent semantic indexing LSI is an information retrieval technique based on the spectral analysis of the termdocument matrix whose empirical success had heretofore been without rigorous prediction and explanation.
We prove that under certain conditions LSI does succeed in capturing the underlying semantics of the corpus and achieves improved retrieval performance.
We also propose the technique of random projection as a way of speeding up LSI.
We complement our theorems with encouraging experimental results.
We also argue that our results may be viewed in a more general framework as a theoretical basis for the use of spectral methods in a wider class of applications such as collaborative fltering.
Even though Theorem gives an asymptotic result and only claims that the probability approaches as the size parameters grow the phenomenon it indicates can be observed in corpora of modest sizes as is seen in the following experiment.
We generated documents each  to  terms long from a corpus model with  terms and  topics.
Each topic is assigned a disjoint set of terms as its primary set.
The probability distribution for each topic is such that of its probability density is equally distributed among terms from the primary set and the remaining is equally distributed among all the terms.
Thus this corpus model is separable.
We measured the angle not some function of the angle such as the cosine between all pairs of documents in the original space and in the rank LSI space.
The following is a typical result; similar results are obtained from repeated trials.
Call a pair of documents intra
topic if the two documents are generated from the same topic and inter
topic otherwise Here angles are measured in radians.
It can be seen that the angles of intratopic pairs are dramatically reduced in the LSI space.
Although the minimum intertopic angle is rather smallindicating that some intertopic pairs can be close enough to be confused the average and the standard deviation show that such pairs are extremely rare.
Results from experiments with different sizeparameters are also similar in spirit.
In this and the other experiments reported here we used SVDPACKC for singular value decomposition.
